# PraiseDemo
This is the source code for my demo portfolio. It features a basic FSM and the minimum code for the AI to handle different Factions and a Navigation system so the characters can walk through paths, travel through different zones or visit different types of buildings. More details about it in my drive folder (conctact me if you are interested)
